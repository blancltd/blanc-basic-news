=============

Default: ``10``

The number of news posts on any list page, such as the news index page, and
category list pages.

NEWS_TITLE
==========

Default: ``'News'``

The title used in RSS feeds. You should probably just use the site name here,
don't append "News" as this is what users of RSS clients are expecting anyway.

Default: ``10``

The number of news posts served by RSS feeds.
